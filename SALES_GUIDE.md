## Objections & Responses

### "Can I do it myself?"

**Response:**
"Sure, but consider: Design takes 40 hours, development takes 60+ hours, deployment is complex. At minimum wage, that's $1,000+ in time. My service gets you done in 48 hours, tested, and deployed. Plus, you get my ongoing support and I handle updates."

### "Why not use Wix/Squarespace?"

**Response:**
"Those are good for simple sites, but for service businesses, you need portfolio management, inquiry tracking, and a professional appearance. Plus, you're locked into their ecosystem with limited customization. With my solution, you own everything and can make it exactly what you want."

### "This is too expensive"

**Response:**
"Traditional agency quotes are $5,000-10,000. You're getting a professionally designed, fully functional site for 1/5 the price because I've templated the process. Plus, no hidden costs and transparent pricing."

### "I need more features"

**Response:**
"Great! I build custom on top of this foundation. What features? Let's quote those separately. The base package gets you live fast, then we can add specific functionality."

### "Can I modify it later?"

**Response:**
"Absolutely. You own the website and the code. If you want to hire developers later, they can easily modify it. Or I can handle modifications on retainer. You're not locked in."
